# Merging

Merging changes into the repository should be done using the local `ng-dev` toolset:
```sh
yarn ng-dev pr merge <pr number>
```

PRs should be reviewed by at least one other member of the dev-infra team before merging.

Any member of the dev-infra team is able to merge "merge ready" PRs as needed.
