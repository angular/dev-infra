      Thank you for submitting your feature request! Looks like during the polling
      process it didn't collect a sufficient number of votes to move to the next stage.


      We want to keep Angular rich and ergonomic and at the same time be mindful about
      its scope and learning journey. If you think your request could live outside
      Angular's scope, we'd encourage you to collaborate with the
      [community](https://angular.io/resources?category=community) on publishing it
      as an open source [package](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries).


      You can find more details about the feature request process in our
      [documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/e29eb8abfbfdfb793e08ac88e14b7ba6d2ff2136/docs/GITHUB_PROCESS.md#feature-request-process).

      This feature request is now candidate for our backlog! In the next phase, the community has 60 days to
      upvote. If the request receives more than 20 upvotes, we'll move it
      to our consideration list.

  warn-comment:
    description: 'A warning that the end of voting is approaching.'
    default: >
      Just a heads up that we kicked off a community voting process for your feature request. There are 20 days until the voting process ends.
