description: |
  Create a pull request from the current changes in the working copy.

  Skip creating the pull request if no files have changed or if a pull request already exists (for the same changes and branches).

author: Angular

inputs:
  branch-prefix:
    required: true
    description: |
      The prefix of the branch name.

      It will be combined with a hash computed from the changed files to generate the branch name.

      Example: `branch-prefix: my-task-branch`
  pr-title:
    required: true
    description: |
      The pull request title. (This is also used as the commit message header.)

      Example: `pr-title: docs(foo): update bar`
  pr-description:
    required: true
    description: |
      The pull request description. (This is also used as the commit message body.)

      Example:
      ```yaml
      pr-description: |
        A very important change
        that cannot be described in a single line.

        Additional info...
      ```
  pr-labels:
    required: false
    description: |
      A list of newline-separated labels to add to the pull request.

      Example:
      ```yaml
      pr-labels: |
        action: review
        target: patch
      ```
  clean-up-branches:
    required: false
    default: true
    description: |
      Enable/Disable automatically cleaning up branches.

      By default, this action will check for and delete obsolete branches - i.e. branches that start with the specified `branch-prefix` and correspond to closed pull requests.
      To skip the automatic clean up of obsolete branches, set this option to `false`.

      Example: `clean-up-branches: false`
