name: Upload Artifacts to Firebase previews
author: 'Angular'
description: |
  Action that downloads a named artifact from a GitHub workflow and uploads
  it to a Firebase preview channel. The deployment to Firebase happens through
  a separate upload artifact workflow to avoid executing build processes in
  privileged environments.

  Following best-practices from:
  https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests

# NOTE: There are two categories of input data to this action:
#
#  - TRUSTED: Values for such inputs should not be changeable by third-parties.
#             This is information usually hard-coded in the privileged job running from `main`.
#
#  - RISK: These inputs are considered unsafe and values may be abused by third-parties.
#          This is usually information coming directly from the build job portion.
inputs:
  github-token:
    required: true

      TRUSTED: GitHub Token used for creating the commit statuses.

  workflow-artifact-name:
    required: true
    description: |
      TRUSTED: Name of the artifact that should be deployed. A workflow may contain
      multiple artifacts but only a single one can be picked for deployment.

  firebase-config-dir:
    default: './'
    description: |
      TRUSTED: Project-relative path to the directory containing the `firebase.json` file.
  firebase-public-dir:
    required: true
    description: |
      TRUSTED: Project-relative path to the directory where artifacts should be put into.
  firebase-project-id:
    required: true
    description: |
      TRUSTED: ID of the Firebase project used for deployment.
  firebase-service-key:
    required: true
    description: |
      TRUSTED: Contents of a Firebase service key authorizing the deployment.
