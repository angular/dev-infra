 * Normalizes the a circular dependency by ensuring that the path starts with the first

 * specific node the first element in the path that represents the cycle.
 *
 * This method is helpful because the path of circular dependencies changes based on which
 * file in the path has been visited first by the analyzer. e.g. Assume we have a circular
 * dependency represented as: `A -> B -> C`. The analyzer will detect this cycle when it
 * visits `A`. Though when a source file that is analyzed before `A` starts importing `B`,
 * the cycle path will detected as `B -> C -> A`. This represents the same cycle, but is just
 * different due to a limitation of using a data structure that can be written to a text-based
 * golden file.
 *
 * To account for this non-deterministic behavior in goldens, we shift the circular
 * dependency path to the first node based on alphabetical order. e.g. `A` will always
 * be the first node in the path that represents the cycle.
