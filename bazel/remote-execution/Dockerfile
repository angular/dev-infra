# Switch back to `root` because Puppeteer sets up a non-root user in the
# image- preventing us from preparing Firefox dependencies.
USER root

# Perform update/upgrade with Debian bullseye added.
# This allows us to install Firefox for its dependencies.

RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get -y upgrade

# Install Firefox so that all dependencies are available. Firefox will
