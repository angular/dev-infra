"""
  Rule that can be used to download and unpack a browser archive in a dedicated Bazel
  repository. Additionally, files within the archive can be denoted with an unique name
  so that web tests can access browser files in a platform-agnostic way, regardless of
  which `browser_archive` repository is added as dependency.

  As an example for the concept of denoting archive files with an unique name, consider a case
  where a web test decides conditionally based on the current exec platform which
  `browser_archive` repository is used (e.g. mac, windows or linux). The archives are different
  for each platform. The test usually would need to determine the current platform, and know how
  each archive is structured in order to access the browser binary within the repository. By
  defining named files  though, the web test could just pull a named file called `BINARY` that
  always resolves to the browser binary in a platform-agnostic way.

  Note #1: This rule exists as an alternative to the `platform_http_file` concept
  from `rules_webtesting` because the `platform_http_file` rule does not extract the archive
  directly, but relies on later build actions to perform the unpacking. This results in less
  efficient caching because build actions are invalidated more frequently (e.g. `bazel clean).
  We also noticed that the extraction within RBE containers is rather unstable, and extracting
  the archives as part of a Bazel repository mitigates this (as extractions happens on the host).

  Note #2: Additionally `rules_webtesting` defines a single repository for all platforms,
  where only an archive for the current host platform is pulled. This breaks cross-compilation
  because the wrong platform archive would be used for web tests that run in the exec platform.
