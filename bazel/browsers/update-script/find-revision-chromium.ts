/**
 * @fileoverview
 * Script that fetches the latest revision currently in the "stable" channel of Chromium.
 * It then checks if build artifacts on the CDN exist for that revision. If there are missing
 * build artifacts, it looks for more recent revisions, starting from the determined revision
 * in the stable channel, and checks if those have build artifacts. This allows us to determine
 * a Chromium revision that is as close as possible to the "stable" channel and we have CDN
 * artifacts available for each supported platform.
 *
 * This is needed because Chromium does not build artifacts for every revision. See:
 * https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/2567#issuecomment-393436282
 *
 * Note: An explicit revision can be specified as command line argument. This allows
 * for finding snapshot builds if a revision is already known. e.g. consider a case
 * where a specific Chromium bug (needed for the Angular org) is fixed but is ahead
 * of the current revision in the stable channel. We still may want to update Chromium
 * to a revision ahead of the specified revision for which snapshot builds exist.
