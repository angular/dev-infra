/*
 * ###############################################################
 *
 * This file contains helpers for invoking external `ng-dev` commands. A subset of actions,
 * like building release output or setting aν NPM dist tag for release packages, cannot be
 * performed directly as part of the release tool and need to be delegated to external `ng-dev`
 * commands that exist across arbitrary version branches.
 *
 * In a concrete example: Consider a new patch version is released and that a new release
 * package has been added to the `next` branch. The patch branch will not contain the new
 * release package, so we could not build the release output for it. To work around this, we
 * call the ng-dev build command for the patch version branch and expect it to return a list
 * of built packages that need to be released as part of this release train.
