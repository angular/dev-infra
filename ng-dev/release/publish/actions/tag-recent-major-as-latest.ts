 * Release action that tags the recently published major as latest within the NPM
 * registry. Major versions are published to the `next` NPM dist tag initially and
 * can be re-tagged to the `latest` NPM dist tag. This allows caretakers to make major
 * releases available at the same time. e.g. Framework, Tooling and Components
 * are able to publish v12 to `@latest` at the same time. This wouldn't be possible if
 * we directly publish to `@latest` because Tooling and Components needs to wait
 * for the major framework release to be available on NPM.
 * @see {CutStableAction#perform} for more details.
