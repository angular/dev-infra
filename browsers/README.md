# Browser configuration and versioning for testing of Angular

Within the Angular organization, we use Chrome and Firefox to perform most of the local testing,
and rely on Sauce Labs and BrowserStack to do cross-browser testing on our CI.

The version of Chrome used in tests within this monorepo is configured and controlled via
Bazel and `puppeteer`. We manually keep the configuration of these two tools in sync to
create a consistent testing environment across unit, e2e, and integration tests.

## Bazel

Bazel `karma_web_test_suite` and `protractor_web_test_suite` targets will use Chromium
or Firefox provisioned by `//dev-infra/browsers`. The version of Chrome and Firefox are
specified in the `chromium.bzl` and `firefox.bzl` files in `/dev-infra/browsers`.

The process of updating the Chrome or Firefox version is not straightforward, but below
are dedicated sections for each browser.

## Updating Chromium

1) Visit https://chromium.woolyss.com/ and note the version (commit position) of the latest
stable version.

For example, "Google Chrome 83.0.4103.97 (756066) â€¢ Wednesday, 3 Jun 2020". Alternatively, you
can look in https://omahaproxy.appspot.com/.

1) Find the closest commit position number available for each platform in chromium-browser-snapshots:
   https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html

   For example:
   * https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Linux_x64/756066/
   * https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Mac/756053/
   * https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win/756065/

   You can download Chromium for your local platform and double check that the `--version` matches
   up with what you expect.

   For example:
    ``` bash
    $ ~/Downloads/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium --version
    Chromium 83.0.4103.0
    ```

2) Update the chrome & chrome driver build numbers in `dev-infra/browsers/chromium/chromium.bzl`
and run either run `bazel query @org_chromium_chromium_amd64//...` to prompt Bazel to calculate
the new `sha256` for each platform binary or determine the new `sha256` values manually.

    Here is an example with `curl` & `shasum`:
    ``` bash
    curl https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/Linux_x64/756066/chrome-linux.zip | shasum -a 256
    ```

## Puppeteer

Visit https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md to determine which version
of puppeteer corresponds to the version of Chrome desired. Then update
`scripts/puppeteer-chrome-versions.js` and all of the puppeteer versions throughout the repo,

* `package.json`
* `aio/package.json`
* `aio/tools/examples/shared/package.json`

and their corresponding `yarn.lock` files.

## Firefox

In order to update Firefox, open the `dev-infra/browsers/firefox/firefox.bzl` file and update
the repository URLs to the desired version. e.g.

```bzl
platform_http_file(
    name = "org_mozilla_firefox_amd64",
    licenses = ["reciprocal"],  # MPL 2.0
    sha256 = "bde6e020556a21561e4b8d7aaecf8db7077951f179b98ca5d0305435bc6802c9",
    # Firefox v78.0
    urls = ["https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/78.0/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-78.0.tar.bz2"],
)
```

Go to the `urls` property and update the URL by replacing all `78.0` occurrences with the
version you intend to use. Once done, do the same change for other platforms (such as `macos`).

Finally, update the `sha256`checksum of the browser archives. You can do this by downloading the
artifacts from the URLs you just updated, and then running on those files: `sha256 <path>`.
